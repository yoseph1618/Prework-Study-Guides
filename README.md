# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This Webpage helps me to see and review the different aspects of building a Webpage and programming.
In this project I'm able to see the ins and outs of web development and review all my notes for different programming aspects in a central Hub.
While creating this Webpage I was able to get a grasp on the procedures of creating, updating, and finalizing a simple webpage all while making an organized place for review and study.

Refer the the subheading of one of these topics on the page to read the information and notes about it.  And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running.
